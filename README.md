Project Title: Pomodoro Timer

Description:
The Pomodoro Timer is a dynamic and user-friendly web application designed to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique for enhanced productivity. This time management method uses intervals, traditionally set for 25 minutes of focused work followed by short breaks, to optimize concentration and minimize burnout.

Key Functionalities:

Customizable Durations: Users can easily set and adjust the durations for work and break sessions to fit their preferences.

Start, Pause, and Reset: The timer allows users to start, pause, and reset their sessions, providing flexibility throughout the work process.

Session Display: Clearly indicates whether the user is in a work or break session, along with the remaining time, promoting awareness and focus.

Technology Stack:

Built with React for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and enhanced code maintainability.

Integrates custom UI components for a polished look and feel.

Context:
This project is the fourteenth in the 30 Days of 30 Projects series initiated by the Governor IT Initiative Program. It emphasizes practical application of web development skills, particularly in implementing time management strategies that are beneficial for both students and professionals.

With the Pomodoro Timer, users can effectively manage their time, enhance productivity, and cultivate healthier work habits. This project serves as an excellent tool for anyone looking to boost focus and efficiency in their daily tasks.
